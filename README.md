In 2012 I found a Whatsapp vulnerability in the SMS platform for the code verification. With a simple script I was able to send a SMS to each registered phone with Whatsapp, without any restriction.

The script is developed for spanish mobile phones (+34), if you want to change it to another country, you should change the country code "34".
